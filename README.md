# Calculator

This frontend project is to use the skills learned at FreeCodeCamp.

The stories from this project are listed on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator).

Below I've listed them incase that changes;

1. User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
1. User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
1. User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
